# Human-Computer Interaction Lab Activity 1

## Project Overview

This project is a personal webpage developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab Activity 1. The webpage serves as an introduction to the developer, Adriaan M. Dimate, providing insights into his background, interests, likes, dislikes, favorite foods, and preferred songs. The live version of the site is accessible at [https://dimatehciact1lab.netlify.app/](https://dimatehciact1lab.netlify.app/).

## File Descriptions

### index.html
The primary file that structures the content of the webpage. It includes sections such as:
- **About Me**
- **Likes**
- **Dislikes**
- **Favorite Food**
- **Liked Songs**

Each section provides personal insights into Adriaan's preferences and interests. The HTML is structured using semantic tags to ensure clarity and accessibility.

### deco.css
This file applies styles to the webpage, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design. It defines styles for:
- Fonts
- Colors
- Layouts
- Responsiveness

These styles enhance the user experience across different devices.

### javasuck.js
The JavaScript file is intended for interactive functionalities. However, it appears minimal or empty in its current state. Future enhancements could include adding interactive features to improve user engagement.

### Images
- **1.jpg**: Image file used within the webpage, possibly as a profile picture or decorative element.
- **background-about.jpg**: Background image for the "About Me" section, adding visual context to the content.

## Development Considerations

In developing this webpage, the following HCI principles were likely considered:
- **User-Centered Design**: Content is organized intuitively, providing clear sections for easy navigation.
- **Consistency and Standards**: Consistent styling and layout are applied throughout the webpage.
- **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: The design avoids unnecessary elements, focusing on meaningful content.

## Future Enhancements

To improve the webpage, consider these enhancements:
1. **Interactive Elements**: Implement JavaScript functionalities to add interactivity, such as dynamic content updates or user input handling.
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Follow web accessibility guidelines by adding alt text to images and ensuring sufficient color contrast.
3. **Responsive Design**: Further enhance CSS to ensure an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

By focusing on these areas, the webpage can provide a more engaging and user-friendly experience, aligning with best practices in human-computer interaction.
